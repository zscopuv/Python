### 1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**
   - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1, and continues as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc. Mathematically, the sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
   - `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`: with seed values F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
